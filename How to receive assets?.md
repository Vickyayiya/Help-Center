Portkey supports the effortless management of your crypto assets. You can receive crypto assets within the aelf network and from other networks including Ethereum, Solana, and TON.

### To receive tokens within the aelf network (for instance from other Portkey accounts or other wallets on aelf)
1. Tap the "Receive" button on the Portkey home screen and select the token you wish to receive.
2. Choose the "Source" and "Destination" networks, either aelf MainChain or aelf dAppChain.
3. After selecting the networks, your wallet address and a QR code will be displayed. Share the address with the sender or have the sender scan the QR code to complete the transfer.
    - Note: Make sure the sender's account matches the source network to avoid asset loss.
4. Once the transfer is complete, check your balance for updates. Your assets will appear in your account shortly.
> **Note:** If you receive ELF from exchanges like Binance or MEXC, ensure you select aelf MainChain as both the "Source" and "Destination" network. Supported exchanges for Mainnet ELF token transfers to Portkey wallet include Binance, OKX, Upbit, Bithumb, Gate, MEXC, and Hotcoin.  
Important note: Only send ELF tokens from the above exchanges, as other tokens are not supported and will result in asset loss.
